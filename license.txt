This application is covered by two different BSD-licenses, and the Apache 2.0 license. 

For version 2.0+, a screen capture scaling technique from playwright.js is used for CSS pixel mode.  Playwright (https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is coverd under Apache 2.0 (2004) license (see https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/LICENSE).  
Playwright contains code derived from the Puppeteer project (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), also available under the Apache 2.0 license (see https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/LICENSE).


The following files (from versions prior to 2.0) are covered by License A below:

image-analysis.js
background-image-analysis.js

(from North Carolina State University) and 


Files previously used to facilitate screen capture (largely based on the existing extension "Screen Capture (by Google) -- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-capture-by-google/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg/details" were covered by License B (from Google). But these files are no longer used after v2.0.


Changes made with version 2.0 and later by Jeff Witt Consulting and/or YRA Tech are Copyright (c) YRA Tech 2025-2026, and are covered by License B, the BSD 3-clause license.
